# Diet:

_Short link to this section_: [HumanMicrobiome.info#Diet](http://HumanMicrobiome.info#Diet)

***"What we eat becomes who we are."***

## Impacts & limitations:

_Short link to this section_: [HumanMicrobiome.info#impacts--limitations](http://HumanMicrobiome.info#impacts--limitations)

These studies explain the impacts and limitations of diet on shaping the gut microbiome:

In short, diet changes the percentages of microbes already there, based on which microbes thrive most on what you're feeding them. And diet changes what metabolites are created, but generally does not change the fundamental make up of the gut microbiome. To change it fundamentally would require adding/subtracting microbes via interventions like FMT, antimicrobials, and possibly probiotics. Though long-term starvation of microbial populations via absence of dietary components such as fiber, can result in extinctions that persist and compound over generations. 

Influence of early life exposure, host genetics and diet on the mouse gut microbiome and metabolome (2016): http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016221

Long-term dietary intervention reveals resilience of the gut microbiota despite changes in diet and weight (Mar 2020, n=49) https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ajcn/nqaa046/5809430

Macronutrient differences impact western gut microbiome, but not Hadza gut microbiomes (Jeff Leach 2018): https://youtu.be/tjLW_DaQ9qI?t=2305

Diabetes-Associated Alterations in the Cecal Microbiome and Metabolome are Independent of Diet or Environment in the UC Davis Type 2-Diabetes Mellitus Rat Model (2018): https://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpendo.00203.2018

Obesity-Linked Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis Associated with Derangements in Gut Permeability and Intestinal Cellular Homeostasis Independent of Diet (mice, 2018): https://dx.doi.org/10.1155%2F2018%2F3462092

Diet matters less than evolutionary relationships in shaping gut microbiome. Study is the largest published comparative dataset of non-human primate gut microbiomes to date. https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-07/nu-dml073018.php | Evolutionary trends in host physiology outweigh dietary niche in structuring primate gut microbiomes (2018): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-018-0175-0

Diet-induced extinctions in the gut microbiota compound over generations (2016): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4850918 - but reintroducing the food (fiber in this instance) does not return the microbes. 

"So why can’t we supplement our diet with short-chain fatty acids? The ecosystem that produces the acids may be as important as the acids themselves. Trials testing prebiotics: only individuals who already harbored a baseline diversity benefited from these dietary interventions. Those whose microbial communities were too impoverished didn’t—or couldn’t—respond to the new diet. They seemed to lack the ability. You can eat all the fiber you want (unless your food is contaminated with feces) and you’ll never re-acquire microbes like H. pylori. The only way to restore such microbes may be to deliberately reintroduce them." http://nautil.us//issue/30/identity/how-the-western-diet-has-derailed-our-evolution

Many koalas could only eat certain species of eucalyptus. But after FMT from other koalas who were able to eat other species, it allowed them to also digest it [[2018](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/06/fecal-transplants-might-help-save-vulnerable-koalas)], [[2019](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-08-21/poo-transplants-can-alter-koalas-gut-microbiome/11431884)].

Same phenomena in packrats: Woodrats lost their ability to eat toxic creosote bushes after antibiotics killed their gut microbes. Woodrats that never ate the plants were able to do so after receiving fecal transplants with microbes from creosote-eaters https://archive.unews.utah.edu/news_releases/fecal-transplants-let-packrats-eat-poison/

Anti-inflammatory effects of a dietary intervention were not related to changes in gut microbiota composition during the intervention, but were correlated with microbiota composition at baseline (2018): https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0381-7 "Role of whole grains versus fruits and vegetables in reducing subclinical inflammation and promoting gastrointestinal health in individuals affected by overweight and obesity: a randomized controlled trial."

Benefits of fasting and the ketogenic diet are dependent on the gut microbiome, and the benefits can be transferred via FMT [[1](https://archive.fo/pPlUR)][[2](https://archive.fo/EJk8V)][[3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13311-019-00719-2)][[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64961-x)]. 

"effects of individual differences outweighed the effect of experimental diets" https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01604-18

Diet can impact bacteria's phage production [[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2018.11.016)]. 

Influence of short-term changes in dietary sulfur on the relative abundances of intestinal sulfate-reducing bacteria (Feb 2019): https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2018.1559682 "we could not detect a change with dietary treatments. These observations are consistent with re-analysis of two previously published dietary intervention studies"

[The role of short-chain fatty acids](https://medium.com/@thryve/the-role-of-short-chain-fatty-acids-41fa3f14409f), by Jun Kim Ph.D.

Fiber intake is associated with gut microbial diversity, and gut microbial diversity is generally good. So a variety of whole, fibrous foods from legumes, fruits, and vegetables (including root veg) is generally recommended[[1](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-016-0155-6)][[2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193152441630264X)][[3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224416305283)][[4](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apt.13248/abstract)][[5](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2016.1270809)][[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28219317)]. **However**, since fiber feeds a broad range of microbes it can feed problematic ones as well. Thus "person to person variation" reigns supreme. One study showed that **removing fiber** from the diet improved all constipation symptoms and **increased BM frequency**[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435786/)]! 

**Iron** [may be feeding pathogens in some people](https://archive.fo/9Tjco). Experiment with removing iron rich foods/supplements from your diet.

Purified/processed fibers are not adequate (in regards to protecting mucus barrier)[[1](https://archive.fo/qzDo3),[2](https://archive.fo/WsVSz),[3](https://archive.fo/2ITWJ)].

There is a very significant variation from person to person (depending on their unique gut microbiome) regarding reactions to "generally healthy" foods. So you should definitely experiment for yourself and not force something that makes you feel worse but is very healthy for most other people [[1](http://msystems.asm.org/content/1/5/e00098-16)][[2](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/101/12/4681/2765040)][[3](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-016-0178-x)][[4](https://archive.fo/Lqv44)][[5](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2018.09.012)][[6](https://www.livescience.com/65737-how-diet-affects-gut-microbioime.html)][[7](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464616304418)].

TMAO is a bacterial metabolite linked to heart disease. It is produced by gut bacteria after eating meat (dietary l-carnitine). But vegetarians can lack the bacteria that make TMAO, so their levels don't increase after eating meat. The same effect can be reproduced using antibiotics. http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/183/183ec75

Bacterial community response to cruciferous vegetables was individual-specific (2009): Human Gut Bacterial Communities Are Altered by Addition of Cruciferous Vegetables to a Controlled Fruit- and Vegetable-Free Diet https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/139/9/1685/4670531

"In the human study, two distinct and inverse responses to tart cherry consumption were associated with initial levels of Bacteroides" (2018): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955286317307143

Age is an important factor in this variation of responses to diet [[1](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/7/929/htm)][[2](https://archive.fo/q0uJb)][[3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653517309207)]. As is sex [[1](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02236)]. 

**Elimination diets** are extremely useful to figure out exactly what is good and bad for you. Establish a baseline by starting out with a liquid (milk, 100% fruit/vegetable juice, broth, water, etc.) you know you tolerate well, then add in one food at a time to see how it makes you feel. Do not ignore the [impact of spices](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/6/1425/htm) when doing this! Many of them are officially prebiotics, and nearly all of them have phytochemicals like antioxidants, flavonoids, carotenoids, and polyphenols, which either feed bacteria or cause specific shifts in the gut microbiome that may be beneficial/detrimental to various people. 

Keto, carnivore, and 80/10/10 are all types of elimination diets. 

Be **extremely** skeptical of suggestions that detrimental impacts are actually a good thing because they represent "die off/herx". This is probably one of the top most widespread & dangerous pieces of misinformation. If you are not seeing significant improvements from baseline after dipping below baseline from a hypothesized bad reaction from harmful microbes dying off, then you are likely simply harming yourself. Any genuine [herx reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarisch%E2%80%93Herxheimer_reaction#Signs_and_symptoms) should also be very temporary (1-2 days).

Review, 2016: Gut microbiota role in dietary protein metabolism and health-related outcomes: The two sides of the coin https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224416303612

[Rat study] Nitrogen availability (protein intake) is a main factor in shaping the gut microbiome & health [[1](https://archive.fo/4Chhf)]. Low protein, high carb diet associated with beneficial health markers: [[1](https://archive.is/xrC0v),[2](https://archive.is/YI4zg)]

Low protein diet is recommended based on the evidence that excessive protein intake adversely affect health [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28215168)][[2](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/3/337/htm)][[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/3/514)].

Worse inflammatory profile in omnivores than in vegetarians associates with the gut microbiota composition: https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-017-0261-x

In general, fermentation metabolites from carbohydrates and associated phenolic compounds have beneficial effects; by the contrary protein derived fermentation products are detrimental for health [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214799317300577)]. 

There's a big difference between types/sources of fats & proteins [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996918305829)][[2](http://www.molmetab.com/article/S2212-8778\(16\)30189-2/pdf)][[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/2/418/htm)]. The body processes them differently, thus they have very different impacts on weight and gut microbiome. [Soy oil vs coconut oil](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-5202-z).

## Limitations:

Current limitations and unknowns are extreme. There are a plethora of microbes which are either unknown and/or not tested for currently. 16s only tests for bacteria, and not down to the strain level, which is of vital importance. 

This recent study for example, showing one bacterial strain inducing liver damage (2018): http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0198262 - That kind of thing is absolutely not tested for with either conventional, or 16s commercial testing. 

Till mid 2016 they were only able to culture an estimated 1% of gut microbes: https://archive.is/JnStd – http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v533/n7604/full/nature17645.html 

Only 35 to 65% of molecular species detected by sequencing have representative strains in culture (Apr 2017): http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2017.1320468 

Using advanced metagenomics techniques, researchers have found that conventional culture-based lab tests may misdiagnose as many as half of the microbial causes of diarrheal diseases in children (Nov 2019) https://rh.gatech.edu/news/629100/metagenomics-unlocks-unknowns-diarrheal-disease-cases-children

8/21/2017 Stanford study using shotgun sequencing says we still don't know 99% of human microbes: https://archive.is/wgucb 

9/16/2017 From an international database of more than 1,500 metagenomes, the UQ team reconstructed the individual genomes of 7,280 new bacteria and 623 new archaea. Of these microorganisms, roughly a third were unlike anything scientists had seen before, warranting the creation of 17 new bacterial phylums and three new achaeal phylums. https://futurism.com/scientists-just-discovered-organisms-that-are-distinct-from-any-life-forms-known-to-science/

2/27/2019: "Current gold standard sequencing procedures do not permit the determination of taxa abundances per gram of stool, but only provide proportional information on the fraction of the microbiota belonging to a particular genus in the sequenced library. Changes in total microbial density in faecal samples might be a key feature of a dysbiotic ecosystem and therefore a crucial element in microbiome-based diagnostics. Amplicon sequencing provides no information on metabolic potential, and library preparation biases exaggerate the relative abundance of dominant taxa" https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17843286.2019.1583782

"It's not enough to study the composition, or the increase or decrease of a species. We also have to understand how the microbiota sense us, and how they change their 'behavior' accordingly." (May 2019) https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-05/asfm-hsb051019.php

8/14/2019: Research conducted by scientists from Harvard Medical School and Joslin Diabetes Center uncovered a "staggering microbial gene diversity". More than half of the bacterial genes examined occurred only once (called “singletons”) and were specific to each individual https://hms.harvard.edu/news/microbial-fingerprinting

## Commercial testing:

_Short link to this section_: [HumanMicrobiome.info#commercial-testing](http://HumanMicrobiome.info#commercial-testing)

Current (2018) commercial testing (16s) has **very** limited value. Here's a [great write up by a microbiologist about it](https://archive.is/gUXqF). More: [[1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-018-5299-6)][[2](https://www.darkdaily.com/at-home-microbiology-tests-trigger-concerns-about-scientific-value-and-impact-from-microbiologists-and-clinical-laboratory-scientists-1016)][[3](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603900/gut-check-scientists-are-wary-of-at-home-microbiome-tests/)][[4](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.117.156380)] - including commentary from Rob Knight and others. A [real life example](https://archive.fo/qnuRs). Another [researcher/professor in the field agreeing](https://archive.is/YS2ds). Excellent [podcast that supports and gets into the details](https://archive.fo/6OfAd).

A major factor is also that most testing is only for bacteria, but it's looking like phages might be more important. There's also fungi and archaea. 

Commercial tests are currently using 16s sequencing, which is mostly only accurate to the genus level. Data at this level is not especially useful [[1](https://archive.is/O39RL)][[2](https://archive.is/Np2Im)][[3](https://archive.is/mrkdX)][[4](https://archive.is/j3g8d)][[5](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/15/176677)][[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4517)]. 

Here are a few articles questioning the accuracy of these tests: [[1](https://mrheisenbug.wordpress.com/2014/04/24/dear-american-gut-ubiome-you-have-some-explaining-to-do)][[2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/big-data-studies-come-replication-challenges )][[3](https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/gory-details/here%E2%80%99s-poop-getting-your-gut-microbiome-analyzed)]

Here are [examples of the same stool sample sequenced by two different companies, showing different results](https://archive.is/ZNanA). And even major differences for the same stool sample from the same company, done at the same time [[1](https://cfsremission.com/2020/10/10/one-stool-two-samples-one-lab-what-the-shit/)].

Nonsensical results like [this](https://archive.is/VVfpa) are common. And these two studies [[1](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2016.01643/full)][[2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134802)] explain why. Essentially, many people's stools are not uniform, thus depending on which part of the stool you sample, you'll get different results. Thus homogenizing the stool prior to sampling will give more consistent results, but also changes the proportions of the results. This is likely a major problem with uBiome for instance, who use a swab method rather than whole stool. 

Various companies that do it: ubiome, genova, American Gut, viome, uBiota, biocollective, doctor's data, bioscreen. Here's a [comparison of the different microbes each test for](https://cfsremission.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/comparelabs.pdf).

Analysis of Viome: https://microbiomedigest.com/2019/04/25/a-review-of-the-recent-viome-preprint/

["Viome’s claims are not supported by any scientific literature," says Jonathan Eisen, "What they’re saying is, in fact, deceptive."](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2020/02/07/drugs-from-bugs-why-gates-zuck-and-benioff-think-the-next-blockbusters-will-come-from-inside-your-gut/)

Here's an [example report from ubiome's $90 explorer kit](https://imgur.com/gallery/rYUjR). And an [example \(and discussion\) of their SmartGut kit](https://archive.fo/qnuRs) that goes through a doctor. 

Here's an [example report from BioScreen](https://archive.is/6uljJ), which goes through a doctor and seems a little more useful.

Here's an [example report from Biocollective.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/353870827/16s-Stool-Results-Biocollective-2016).

Example report from [Genova's GI Effects](http://www.smartnutrition.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Smart-Nutrition-GI-Effects-Microbial-Ecology-Sample-Report1.pdf). 

Example report from [Diagnostic Solutions GI Map](https://www.diagnosticsolutionslab.com/tests/gi-map): https://www.diagnosticsolutionslab.com/sites/default/files/GI-MAP-Sample-Report_ARs.pdf - this one seems very useful. 

Directlabs.com has a variety of tests: https://www.directlabs.com/pop/OrderTests/tabid/35269/language/en-US/Default.aspx - The "Comprehensive Digestive Stool Analysis 2.0™ (CDSA 2.0)-Genova Kit" is probably the most useful one from them. 

[This](https://archive.is/OK57W) is essentially the best input you can expect to get from sharing your results.
