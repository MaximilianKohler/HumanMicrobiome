# Human Microbiome Wiki

[Library of research on the human microbiome](https://humanmicrobiome.info/). Detailing all the ways our microbiomes impact our health, function, and development. Providing answers on how we can maintain or achieve a healthy, eubiotic gut microbiome, and how to prevent and correct dysbiosis. 

I have also now set up a new **[Human Microbiome Community Forum](https://forum.humanmicrobiome.info/)** -- https://forum.humanmicrobiome.info. Studies, articles, and evidence-based discussion on the human microbiome, its impacts on health & society, and what we can do.

[This site](https://humanmicrobiome.info/) is currently built on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). It has lots of [themes](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes). Currently using [Material theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material). Let me know if you have other suggestions. 

Static sites can be hosted free on Github Pages, Cloudflare pages, or Netlify. 

**Static site generators**:

* Material theme - I like it a lot and it's easy to customize, but the [sidebars collapse too soon](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions/3210#discussioncomment-2342214), and [the search is quite bad](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions/4384#discussioncomment-4877684). 
* [Read the docs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/choosing-your-theme/#readthedocs) - MkDocs theme. I like it but the sidebar was a little buggy when it was long enough to scroll. 
* Hugo: [Book theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/) fixes the issues I have with Material theme -- the sidebars don't collapse too soon, and the search is better. But it loses other features and is less customizable _(for novices at least)_ overall; Eg: [the sidebar layout](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book/issues/446).
* I like the [Linode docs](https://gohugo.io/showcase/linode/) layout, but the search is not that good. And it's not a selectable theme. 
* Bookstack - nice but seems to require heavy technical expertise to customize. Also, not static so not free to host. 
* Gatsby: ? https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/
* Jekyll: ? https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/
* Next.js: the search isn't that good; can't [find links](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/measuring-performance#sending-results-to-analytics).
* Eleventy (11ty): simple? https://www.11ty.dev/ - doesn't seem to have a built-in search. Their [docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/edit-on-github-links/) uses [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) which can't find links.

This website was created with the idea in mind that misinformation is harmful, and that it's important to have easily accessible hubs of up-to-date, accurate information on subjects. There is widespread misinformation about so many topics, including the microbiome, probiotics, diet, etc.. Since I've been following the microbiome literature daily for many years I should be able to help stop the spread of misinformation for topics relating to the human microbiome. 

If you have criticisms, suggestions, additions, etc., please [submit them](https://github.com/MaximilianKohler/HumanMicrobiome/issues). 

I will try to keep this site accessible for both lay people and professionals. I don't add every existing study or the wiki would become overbloated and unusable. To see all studies for a given topic you'll need to do a literature search via pubmed or google scholar. 

Please note that I am a layperson and do not have deep technical knowledge. Rather, I have [a broad understanding of human health and development, and the gut microbiome's impacts on the entire body](https://medium.com/@MaximilianKohler/a-critical-look-at-the-current-and-longstanding-ethos-of-childbearing-the-repercussions-its-been-6e37f7f7b13f), with a [focus on FMT](https://maximiliankohler.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html). And since most doctors and researchers don't seem to follow the literature closely it seemed like this is a vacant and important niche I could/should fill. If you are interested in collaboration, expanding, moving the site, etc. feel free to let me know.
